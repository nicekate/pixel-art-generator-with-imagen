# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## üîê Security Notes

- **Never commit API keys!** The `.env.local` file is ignored by git for security
- Create your own `.env.local` file with: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here`
- For production deployment, set environment variables in your hosting platform
